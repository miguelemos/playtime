# PlayTime

PlayTime is a smartphone application that provides a new way of communication between sports athletes (concept). 

Built in 2020 by me and two friends and sold in early 2021 -- just keeping the original concept here since the new implementation has *some* differences.

The original concept pretended the application to be a database of sports athletes (5 sports' categories) that would allow the players to meet new rivals and book directly the field to play -- with a specific date and time. 

Here's the original Domain Model.

Since the application has gone through several interactions until it reached it's final form, I'm sharing here the original Figma drawings that represent the UX.

The app's login page:

The menu page, where you can pick a specific sport (here's only 2 sports represented as an example):

After choosing a sport (e.g. "Tennis"), you get access to the database of all Tennis players available near your region. You can check their basic information (such as Name, Age, Level and Distance -- the "Level" parameter ranges from 1 to 5 and it is based on the player's history sequence of games).

In case you want to see additional data about a specific player, you can click on his/her name and the following page will show up.

Once you reach a player's profile (last image), you have 3 options to follow:
- (0) get back to the overall database of players;
- (1) send a message to the specific player profile you are visiting;
- (2) book a game through the "Let's play" button;

Option (0) has already been explored - you just get back to the previous page. Let's take a look at option (1) and (2):

Once you start booking games, the app allows you to record your history of matches in your profile, which is used in the algorithm to determine the *level* parameter defined above. Here's an example of a player profile showcasing her last 2 games:

At last, the concept of this application was to merge the world of sports with the world of social interactivity. By meeting new people through a similar passion (i.e. a specific sport), you are both being more sociable and healthy through the practice of a sport. We've also designed a page to track down the history of all messages traded in the past, so you can remember old conversations.

And that's it, hope you enjoyed this concept!
