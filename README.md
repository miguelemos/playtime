# PlayTime

PlayTime is a smartphone application that provides a new way of communication between sports athletes (concept). 

Built in 2020 by me and two friends and sold in early 2021 -- just keeping the original concept here since the new implementation has *some* differences.

The original concept pretended the application to be a database of sports athletes (5 sports' categories) that would allow the players to meet new rivals and book directly the field to play -- with a specific date and time. 

Here's the original Domain Model.
